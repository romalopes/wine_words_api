# Central configuration for the configurable email-verification feature.
#
# REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION (default: false):
#   false -> registration and login behave exactly as today; no verification
#            email is sent and no verification is required.
#   true  -> newly registered users must verify their email before they can
#            authenticate and use the application.
#
# EMAIL_VERIFICATION_EXPIRATION_HOURS (default: 24):
#   How long a verification link remains valid after it is generated.
#
# This initializer is the *only* place that reads these ENV keys for auth
# gating purposes. Controllers, models and services must go through
# EmailVerification.require? / EmailVerification.expiration so the feature
# toggle is centralized and never scattered as ENV[...] checks across the
# codebase.
