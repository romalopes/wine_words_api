# Configurable email-verification workflow.
#
# This service object owns everything about verification *except* the small state
# predicates living on the User model (email_verified?, etc.). Keeping the
# workflow here — token creation, delivery, validation, resend throttling —
# keeps the User model's authentication logic separate from verification logic.
#
# All gating uses EmailVerification.require? (the single config accessor) so the
# feature can be toggled off entirely without touching this flow.
